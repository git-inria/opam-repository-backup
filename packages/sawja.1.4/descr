 Sawja provides a high level representation of Java bytecode programs and tools to do static analysis on it.  

Its name stands for Static Analysis Workshop for JAva. Whereas Javalib is dedicated to isolated classes, Sawja handles bytecode programs with their class hierarchy and control flow algorithms. 
Moreover, Sawja provides some stackless intermediate representations of code and tools for static analysis of Java bytecode programs.
